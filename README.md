Hello there! This repo contains all the work I did to understand which data job is better to target and create a path towards bridging healthcare and data. 
## Salary Dashboard
This data jobs salary dashboard was created to help a job seeker and anyone interested in a particular data career identify median salaries for those roles in different countries and the top sites to apply for those roles. It was also created as a guide for those applying for these roles to be used when negotiating for their salaries to ensure they are adequately compensated.

## Salary Analysis
Most people interested in the data space are overwhelmed by trying to settle on which skill they should strive to learn. The lack of data to help them understand what top employers are after in the same roles doesn't make it any better. 

Thus, this was made as a guide to understand if gaining a lot of skills is directly correllated with getting a higher pay.   <img width="874" height="537" alt="2_Project_Analysis_Chart1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82d8bcc0-6231-4b7c-9b0e-fff1789a5c49" />

I also sought to determine whether there were specific top 10 skills most strongly associated with higher pay in data-related roles. The goal was to use these insights as a practical guide for learners, helping them identify which skills to prioritize and 
develop more deeply in order to increase their earning potential.
