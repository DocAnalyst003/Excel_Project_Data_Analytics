Hello there! This repo contains all the work I did to understand which data job is better to target and create a path towards bridging healthcare and data. 
## Salary Dashboard
This data jobs salary dashboard was created to help a job seeker and anyone interested in a particular data career identify median salaries for those roles in different countries and the top site to apply for that role. It was also created as a guide for those applying for these roles to be used when negotiating for their salaries to ensure they are adequately compensated.
